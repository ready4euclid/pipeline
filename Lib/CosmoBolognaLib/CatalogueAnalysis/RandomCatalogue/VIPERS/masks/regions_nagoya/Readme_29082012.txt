~~~ summary ~~~

These are updated region files describing the VIPERS survey geometry.
Let's consider this an alpha release.  Small adjustments may still be
made.  We can discuss further adjustments on the wiki.

These should be almost identical to the previous region files made
available.  Only small adjustments (up to a few arcsec) have been made
to some edges.  We have also corrected for shifts in the WCS, so the
quadrant positions are improved.  Again this change is only ~1 arscec
typically.

Further modifications may still be made.  The WCS correction has only
been made for quadrants for which we have the VIPGI tmp files easily
accessible.
